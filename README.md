Markov Chain Text Generator

This project is a simple text generator that uses a Markov chain algorithm to create new text based on a provided input sample.

Description

The core of this project is to take a piece of text, analyze the probabilistic relationships between its words, and then generate a new sequence of words that mimics the style and structure of the original text. This is achieved by building a Markov chain from the input text, where each word is a state, and the transitions to the next word are based on their frequency in the source text.

How It Works

The process is broken down into three main functions:

buildMarkovChain(text): This function takes a string of text as input. It splits the text into individual words and then iterates through them to build a chain. The chain is a JavaScript object where each key is a word, and its value is an array of all the words that have followed it in the input text.

generateFromChain(chain, length = 50): Once the chain is built, this function generates new text. It starts with a random word from the chain and then iteratively selects the next word from the array of possible followers. This process continues until the desired length of text is reached.

generateText(): This function connects the logic to the user interface. It retrieves the input text from the HTML text area with the ID inputText. It then calls buildMarkovChain to create the chain and generateFromChain to produce the new text. Finally, it displays the generated text in the HTML element with the ID output.

Usage

Enter a sample text into the input field. The more text you provide, the more coherent the generated text will be.

Click the "Generate" button (or trigger the generateText function).

The newly generated text will appear in the output area.

Code
Generated javascript
function buildMarkovChain(text) {
  const words = text.split(/\s+/);
  const chain = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
    const word = words[i];
    const nextWord = words[i + 1];

    if (!chain[word]) {
      chain[word] = [];
    }

    chain[word].push(nextWord);
  }

  return chain;
}

function generateFromChain(chain, length = 50) {
  const words = Object.keys(chain);
  let currentWord = words[Math.floor(Math.random() * words.length)];
  let result = [currentWord];

  for (let i = 0; i < length - 1; i++) {
    const nextWords = chain[currentWord];
    if (!nextWords || nextWords.length === 0) break;

    const nextWord = nextWords[Math.floor(Math.random() * nextWords.length)];
    result.push(nextWord);
    currentWord = nextWord;
  }

  return result.join(' ');
}

function generateText() {
  const input = document.getElementById('inputText').value;
  const output = document.getElementById('output');

  if (!input.trim()) {
    output.textContent = "Please enter training text!";
    return;
  }

  const chain = buildMarkovChain(input);
  const generated = generateFromChain(chain, 50);
  output.textContent = generated;
}
